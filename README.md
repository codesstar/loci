Loci is an open-source framework that gives AI assistants persistent memory, identity awareness, and multi-project orchestration. It turns Claude Code (and potentially other AI coding tools) from a stateless assistant into one that knows who you are, what you're working on, and where you left off.

Named after the [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) — the ancient memory technique of placing ideas in an imagined architectural space — Loci gives your AI a structured place to store and retrieve everything that matters.

> **Why a seahorse?** The hippocampus — the brain region responsible for forming memories — is named after its seahorse-like shape. Our mascot is a reminder: Loci is the memory center of your AI.
>
> **为什么是海马？** 大脑中负责记忆形成的「海马体」（hippocampus），因形似海马而得名。海马体是 Loci 的中文别名，也是我们的 IP。

## The Problem

Every time you start a new conversation with an AI assistant, it starts from zero.

- **ChatGPT memories** are a flat list of disconnected facts. No structure, no hierarchy, no context.
- **Custom GPTs / system prompts** are static. They don't grow with you.
- **Raw dotfiles** (`.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`) give instructions but no memory, no identity, no orchestration.

You end up repeating yourself. Re-explaining your goals. Re-describing your projects. The AI never truly *knows* you — it just follows instructions until the context window runs out.

## The Solution

Loci gives your AI a **memory palace** — a layered, structured, evolving knowledge base that loads automatically and grows with every conversation.

- **Three layers of context** so your AI loads what it needs, when it needs it
- **Conversation distillation** that extracts insights instead of saving raw transcripts
- **Identity modeling** so your AI understands your goals, values, and working style
- **Synapse** — a cross-project information flow system that connects, syncs, and routes knowledge between your brain and sub-projects
- **A web dashboard** to visualize your entire system at a glance

The result: an AI that picks up where you left off, reminds you what matters, and evolves alongside you.

## Quick Start

Get running in 2 minutes. Requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codesstar/loci.git my-brain
cd my-brain

# 2. Launch setup (checks prerequisites, then starts Claude)
bash setup.sh
```

Claude will greet you, ask a few questions, and set up your brain through conversation. No forms, no config files — just talk to your AI.

Everything is local Markdown — no database, no server, no account required. The setup script auto-disconnects from the template repo so your personal data stays private.

> One brain, many projects. Each project connects via `/loci-link` and communicates through the Synapse system. Your brain grows with every conversation, across every terminal.

## Core Concepts

### Three-Layer Context

Not everything needs to load every time. Loci organizes knowledge by access frequency:

| Layer | Loaded | Contents | Example |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **L1** | Every conversation | Identity, active goals, inbox | `plan.md`, `inbox.md` |
| **L2** | On demand | Module details, specific people, finances | `people/john.md` |
| **L3** | Rarely, by request | Archives, old decisions, evolution history | `archive/` |

This keeps your AI fast and focused while maintaining access to deep history when needed.

### Distillation Protocol

Loci never saves raw conversation transcripts. Instead, it **distills** each conversation into structured updates:

- New facts about you go to `me/`
- New decisions go to `decisions/`
- New tasks go to `tasks/active.md`
- New insights go to auto-memory

Think of it as a personal knowledge base that grows automatically — but only with the good parts.

### Growth Tracking

When your goals, values, or identity evolve, Loci doesn't just overwrite the old version. It archives the previous state to `me/evolution.md`, creating a timeline of personal growth that you can revisit anytime.

Current files stay lean (L1). History grows indefinitely (L3). Both are always available.

### Synapse — Cross-Project Information Flow

The **Synapse** system controls how information flows between your brain and sub-projects — like synapses between neurons, selectively transmitting what matters.

Managing multiple projects? Loci uses a **hub-and-spoke** model:

```
Loci Brain (HQ)
├── .loci/links/project-alpha/   → symlink to ~/projects/alpha
│   ├── profile.md             ← Auto-generated project profile
│   ├── from-hq.md             ← Brain writes strategic directives
│   └── to-hq.md               ← Project reports back
├── .loci/links/project-beta/
│   ├── profile.md
│   ├── from-hq.md
│   └── to-hq.md
```

**Connect any folder** to your brain with `/loci-link`. Loci auto-scans the project (README, package.json, directory structure) and creates a profile — your brain knows what each project is from day one.

**Signal-driven persistence** — Loci doesn't burn context saving every message. It watches for meaningful information (new tasks, decisions, insights, personal changes) and saves immediately when detected. You get a one-line notification — never an interrupting question. Say "undo" if it got something wrong.

When you're ready to connect other project folders, one command does it all:

```
/loci-link    — Connect any project folder to your brain
```

Advanced commands (`/loci-sync`, `/loci-settings`, `/loci-brain-settings`, `/loci-scan`) are available when you need fine-grained control. See [docs/departments.md](docs/departments.md) for the full guide.

### Git-Native Memory

Everything is Markdown. Your AI's memory is version-controlled out of the box:

```bash
# See what your AI learned today
git diff

# See your growth over time
git log --oneline me/

# Full history of every decision
git log --oneline decisions/
```

No database migrations, no export tools. Your memory is portable, diffable, and yours forever.

### Dashboard

A local web dashboard (pixel-art style) that visualizes your goals, tasks, inbox, and project status. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no dependencies. Your AI will offer to open it when you have enough data to visualize.
